<hr>
Caller ID spoofing is a spoofing attack which causes the telephone network's Caller ID to indicate to the receiver of a call that the originator of the call is a station other than the true originating station. This can lead to a display showing a phone number different from that of the telephone from which the call was placed.[1]

The term is commonly used to describe situations in which the motivation is considered malicious by the originator.

One effect of the widespread availability of Caller ID spoofing is that, as AARP published in 2019, "you can no longer trust call ID.




Imagine being able to call your friend from the number of their favorite celebrity or even their own phone number, without actually using their device. That's the power of call spoofing!

Call spoofing, also known as caller ID spoofing, is like the ultimate disguise for your phone number. It allows you to customize the caller ID displayed on the recipient's phone, making it appear as if the call is coming from a different number altogether.

Want to surprise your friends with a call from their favorite superhero? Done. Need to maintain privacy by calling from a business number instead of your personal one? No problem. Call spoofing gives you the freedom to control how your calls appear to others.

But with great power comes great responsibility. It's important to use call spoofing ethically and legally. While it can be a fun tool for harmless pranks or enhancing privacy, misuse can lead to serious consequences.

So, whether you're looking to personalize your communication, protect your privacy, or just have a little fun, call spoofing can be a game-changer. Just remember to use it wisely!
